<p> Welcome to my website! I am glad you found it interesting :) Here, you can get to know me a little bit better and understand why logo designs fascinate me and how this interest correlates with my other hobbies.

<h2>My interests
</h2>


<p>
  From a very young age, I was intrigued by the amount of work behind creating a brand and the role design plays in it. As a teenage bibliophile, I was closely watching everchanging logos of prominent as well as smaller and independent publishing houses. By the age of twelve, I had all the logos of Polish book publishers memorised by heart and was able to start learning about booksellers based in the UK as well as the US. The love for books, however, did not end with learning about all the existing publishing houses. I quickly realised that I could create my own brand from scratch to express my love for the written word.

<h2>My beginnings
</h2>

<p>
  I had my first blog at the age of 13. I was reviewing YA and fantasy literature, which allowed me to spread my love for books as well as interact with other bibliophiles. As my website had started gaining traction and publishing houses began to send enquiries about a collaboration with me, I realised that this was the first time I really had to decide what my brand represents and stands for. With my reviews on publishers' websites, I had only one way to stand out from other reviewers' brands - by creating an unforgettable logo. This experience taught me how important a small detail could be responsible for someone's success or failure.

<h2> My experience in marketing
</h2>


<p>
After my journey with blogger.com, I created my first fan page on Facebook. By the age of fifteen, I learnt how important it is to expand your brand. I designed a new logo, banner and found my own aesthetic that I incorporated in all my designs. After a while, I was able to create a logo for the first event I organised, which was a media awareness campaign called "JustTrue". While designing a new logo, I learnt how to design in Canva and Illustrator. My interest in design made me realise that, in the future, I want to be a part of a bigger brand whose logo would make an impact and be recognisable all around the world. This is one of the reasons why I chose my university course, which is Publishing, Media and Journalism. Now, as a twenty-year-old second-year student I can learn about all the things that I was interested in my whole life. Hopefully, after a couple of years, I will be able to combine my love for writing, books and design in order to express myself and the essence of a brand I will be working for.
