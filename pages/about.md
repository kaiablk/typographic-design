The main purpose of my website is at follows: to explore the progression of logos over time, investigating how and why these designs have shifted. The rationale behind the design element of the site was to reflect the title, kaleidoscopes are traditionally iridescent so the logo was intended to represent this nature. The kaleidoscope motif is absolutely intentional, they are always changing and this is intended to showcase the everchanging nature of fonts within the digital age and across time.

Each article will focus on 2 logo progressions, looking at how and why they have changed. These will be linked to popular culture in order to be relatable for the reader. Patterns will be evaluated including certain trends in designs, such as the growing shift towards minimalism, reflecting the statement "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

Context is extremely important and acts as a key sector of my articles, financial growth is one of these key aspects, it will be essential to explore the correlation between a company's financial growth and their change in design. 

Overall, through my design, articles and overall theme of the site, I intend to create a multifacted, kaleidoscopic view of typography and its progression throughout time.
