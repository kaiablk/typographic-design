Microsoft is one of the biggest tech giants who created the software that paved the way for a Digital Age revolution. Paul Allen and Bill Gates, the founders of the company, registered Microsoft in 1975. The first computer kits the two released - the MITS Altair and Altair BASIC - became the prototypes for future generations of computers. 

Because the computers were a very fresh idea, Bill Gates wanted them to be appealing to youth first. The Information Age was considered to be too complicated for older generations, and teenagers seemed like a better target audience. This is why the first logo had the vibe of an 80s disco party when the roller skates were a must-have for every American teenager. What is more, the letters were shaped as if they were a banner for a discotheque. The logo was groovy yet paid attention to detail and appeared confident in its structure. 

The biggest change for the Microsoft logo was changing its name in 1982. The founders decided to go from hyphenated "Micro-Soft" to a one-word "Microsoft". Also, the style of the logo changed, but the redesign lasted only two years and was deemed "a flop". It resembled a logo of the "Metallica" rock band and many fans of the music group were not happy with Gate's choice. This was the last time Microsoft designers tried to appear "edgy" in order o stand out from their competition.

Eventually, the company turned to a safe san serif font. The founders realised that their brand would not find their customers among teenagers but rather in corporate offices - and that was what brought about the biggest change about Microsoft's identity. The company started targetting their products at office workers and big corporations, which changed their work forever. 

The fourth logo was designed by Scott Baker. He played it safe by choosing straightforward sans serif font. At that point, the company was known all over the world as it was after realising OS/2 to OEMs. Baker also wanted the company to send the message of motion and speed by adding a small swoosh onto the O. 

Even though Microsoft is now a well-established company, the designers still work on the giant's logo. The newest addition was a colourful set of blocks in a square. The change was meant to reflect the diversity among the company's products. Yet, most importantly, it was supposed to reminisce the very first product of the brand, which was Windows software.
