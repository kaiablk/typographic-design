Both Adidas and Nike are well-known for the simple logos that can be seen all over the world. The three characteristic stripes of Adidas' design often complement the clothes of athletes during major sports events, while the Nike "swoosh" is printed on banners sponsoring those said matches. In the twentieth century, when graphic designers used to pay a lot of attention to small details in their work, nobody would suspect that a simple swoosh could represent a company now worth $34.8 billion, proving the significance of minimalism in terms of luxury. 

Although Nike and Adidas are the leading manufacturers of sportswear, the ideas and identities hiding behind their logos are very different. Adidas logos always start with a lowercase letter to imply that the brand is accessible to everyone and focuses on providing casual sportswear to people regardless of their financial status. Nike's designer, on the other hand, decided to concentrate on the feelings and emotions that their logo would convey. Carolyn Davidson, while creating the graphic, wanted to evoke a sense of movement and speed. The design, combined with the flagship slogan of Nike, "Just do it", is now associated with persistence and motivation all over the world.

The minimalist approach to the logos turned out to be a great financial choice for both companies. Customers loved the simple design regardless of the fact it did not take a lot of space, it had a really strong and relatable message behind it. Another characteristic that both brands adapted while developing their logos was versatility. Adidas introduced three different logos to express the brand's focus on variety, whilst Nike released its logos in many different colour schemes and added a popular silhouette of Micheal Jordan. This represents the fact that the brand is accessible to everyone but is also trusted by celebrities and accomplished athletes. The incorporation of celebrities in Nike's branding further convinced both existing and potential customers that the brand is aware and proactive about the values they represent such as strength, motivation, perseverance and quality. 

Another characteristic that both brands share is timelessness. The simplicity of their logos allows them to be redesigned in many ways while the main message remains untouched. The versatility of logos also allowed the companies to expand into respectable fashion brands, which although are not related to sportswear anymore, still convey the same core values that customers loved in the first place.
