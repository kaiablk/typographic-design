Starbucks, with over 30,000 stores spread all over the world, is a well-known coffee company that remains one of the most popular multinational chains in its category. Their first logo, together with their first coffeehouse was created in 1971.

Just like with many other early logo designs, the premise for the first design was to make it as detailed as possible. The brand also focused on preparing a rich backstory to stand out from the competition. Yet, as it turned out over time, they created a plot that was too convoluted for their customers to find it interesting. Inspired by Moby Dick, Starbucks was named after one of the characters in his work, Starbuck, the ship’s chief mate. The logo was created with the intention to reflect the naval theme. Therefore, the designers focused on incorporating a marmaid that was supposed to lure customers to the company's coffee as it would nearby sailors. 

Sixteen years after, as the company was bought by Howard Schultz, the logo was deemed unsuccessful and the changes were made to make it more streamlined. Terry Heckler, a designer hired to modify the logo, inspired by the port of Seattle, focused on making the new design fresh and approachable. Most importantly, the colour was changed. The new mermaid became green to reflect the refreshed values of the company and to make it more memorable. Very soon also the words "spices" and "tea" disappeared from the logo in order to make it clearer and easier to recognise.

In 1992 the company decided to make the logo even cleaner. The siren was redesigned to be the main focus of the logo. Yet, just like many other big companies, Starbucks also made the mistake of wanting to try going back to its roots by redesigning the logo to its first, black prototype.The customers were not fond of the new design. The choice to remake the logo turned out to be a failure. Very soon, the company's response to their customers' dissatisfaction was going back to the previous design with even more modern and fresh twists. Today's logo of Starbucks has almost nothing to do with the convoluted backstory it had in the past. Designers chose the format of the logo to represent the worldwide impact of the brand and to make it easy to print on different formats such as banners or coffee cups. The minimalism once again won the hearts of customers and the brand decided to go with the public's voice demanding the logo to represent loyalty and awareness that the customers can relate to.
