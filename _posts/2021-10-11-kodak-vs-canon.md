Kodak, a true pioneer in amateur photography, despite the company's everlasting popularity, has experienced a significant downfall in the recent decade, mainly due to the fast-growing digitalised photography marketplace. Canon, on the other hand, has kept up with cutting-edge technology developments and adapted its designs to users' demands for modern optical and industrial products, which has allowed the company to experience significant financial growth since its establishment in 1937. 

Along with economical and technological changes, both brands have put a lot of effort into creating logos reflecting their company's identity and modern-age graphic design trends. 

The first logo for both Canon and Kodak was created with an attention to small details, as the companies tried to depict their identities in miniature graphics to attract new audiences to their innovative products. Canon's logo portrayed multi-armed goddess Kwanon, whose image symbolised help and compassion. Kodak's logo, although simpler in design, also contained much more details than its current one. 

## Changes

Once big companies realised the importance of the message behind their logos brought upon them by the digital age, they began to adjust the features of their graphics to become more appealing to their customers' needs. Both brands chose to thicken their fonts to appear more confident and convey a sense of certainty to their clients investing in their products. 

Both companies quickly realised the value and significance of the colour palette in logo designs. Following trends around the world, they decided to add colours that evoke feelings such as passion and love with the intention to connect people with the photography industry and its main focus, which is celebration and expression of individuality.

After many decades of experimentation with colours and shapes, Kodak decided to go back to its roots and brought back the simpler version of its logo representing tradition, confidence and stability. At the same time, Kodak chose to withstand the growing pressure of rapid digital development and decided to hold onto their flagship product, the analogue camera, which led to their financial downfall many years later. Meanwhile, Canon, developing new products and following worldwide technological demands, adjusted its logo to the direction that other big companies had adapted. They added sharp serifs to their design, representing elegance and luxury in order to target audiences that valued high quality and followed the technological trends. Their commitment to cutting-edge technology led to their future financial success and worldwide acclamation for their many flagship products.
